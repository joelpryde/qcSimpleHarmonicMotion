qcSimpleHarmonicMotion
==================

Port of Memo's Simple Harmonic Motion processing sketch to a QuartzComposer plugin

This was mostly just done to teach myself how to build Quartz Composer plugins with Cinder.  If you drop this into your Quartz Composer plugin folder you should be able to make compositions and use them in VDMX and such.
